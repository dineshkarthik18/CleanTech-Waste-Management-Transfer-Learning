# CleanTech-Transforming-Waste-Management-Using-Transfer-Learning
CleanTech is a deep learning–based waste classification system that uses transfer learning to automatically identify waste types from images (plastic, paper, metal, glass, organic). The project helps improve waste segregation efficiency and supports smarter, sustainable waste management solutions.
